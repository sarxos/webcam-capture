# Webcam Capture API

This library allows you to use your build-in or external webcam directly from Java. It's designed to abstract commonly used camera features and support various capturing frameworks.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sarxos/webcam-capture.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sarxos/webcam-capture)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/sarxos/webcam-capture.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/sarxos/webcam-capture?branch=master)

## Rationale

Assume situation when your code depends on some capturing framework, but suddenly you have to drop it and use different, maybe newer one (e.g. replace archaic JMF with newest GStreamer). By doing this you will have to rewrite significant piece of your code because these frameworks are completely different and not compatible at all. This is where Webcam Capture API comes to save the world - it was created to remove the burden of such situations so you do not have to rewrite your code never again, but instead you can simply switch the driver class to different one.

## Features

* Simple, thread-safe and non-blocking API,
* No additional software required,
* Supports multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc) and various architectures (32-bit, 64-bit, ARM),

The latest stable version is: **```0.3.12```**

The latest development version is: **```0.3.13-SNAPSHOT```**

## Raspberry PI

_(and other ARM devices)_

The lates version (0.3.10) does not work on ARM just out of the box. To make it working you need to replace version 0.6.2 of BridJ JAR by the [0.6.3-SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=com.nativelibs4java&a=bridj&v=0.6.3-SNAPSHOT) or newer [bridj-0.7-20140918](http://maven.ecs.soton.ac.uk/content/groups/maven.openimaj.org/com/nativelibs4java/bridj/0.7-20140918/bridj-0.7-20140918.jar). Moreover, lately Jonathon Hare from OpenIMAJ team, found a problem described in [bridj #525](https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/issues/525) which causes problems on armhf architecture.

##### Perform Tests

Since Webcam Capture use some part of native code, it's very hard to cover all supported operating systems. I'm always testing it on 64-bit Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP and Vista (both 32-bit), but I have no possibility to test on Raspberry Pi, Mac OS and 32-bit Linux. Please help and test on those systems if you have such possibility.

## Hello World

Code below will capture image from your default webcam and save it in ```hello-world.png``` file:

```java
Webcam webcam = Webcam.getDefault();
webcam.open();
ImageIO.write(webcam.getImage(), "PNG", new File("hello-world.png"));
```

## Capture Drivers

Webcam Capture API defines ```WebcamDriver``` interface which has been already implemented in several _capturing drivers_ build on top of well-known frameworks used to work with multimedia and cameras. Complete list can be found below.

By default (if other driver is not specified) library uses **default driver** which consists of small, refined part of awesome [OpenIMAJ](http://sourceforge.net/p/openimaj/home/OpenIMAJ/) framework wrapped in thread-safe container. However, there are more ready-to-use drivers which can be used as a replacement or addition to the default one. By utilizing those drivers Webcam Capture can be extended with various new features (e.g. IP camera support). 

List of additional capture drivers includes:

Webcam.setDriver(new FFmpegCliDriver());
```

More details on how to use it, how to install, and where necessary binaries can be downloaded, can be found on dedicated [webcam-capture-driver-ffmpeg-cli](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/tree/master/webcam-capture-drivers/driver-ffmpeg-cli) page.


## History

I initially started working on Webcam Capture as a simple proof-of-concept after I read [Andrew Davison](http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/)'s fantastic book entitled [Killer Game Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Killer-Game-Programming-Andrew-Davison/dp/0596007302/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1360352393&sr=1-1&keywords=killer+game+programming) (which is also available [online](http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/)). Thank you Andrew! Later I found that there is a complete mess in Java APIs allowing you to capture images from webcams. Once you choose specific API you cannot change it without modifying large parts of the code. I decided to change this situation and write general purpose wrapper for various different APIs (like JMF, OpenCV, OpenIMAJ, LTI-CIVIL, VLC). In such a way, Webcam Capture as we know it today, was brought to life. Today you can change underlying frameworks just by replacing webcam driver (one line code change). If there is no driver for particular framework, it's very easy to write it yourself.
