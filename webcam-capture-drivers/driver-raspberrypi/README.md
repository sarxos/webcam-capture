# webcam-capture-driver-raspistill

This capture driver is special for raspberrypi. __raspistillï¼Œ raspiyuv, ...__ is the command line tool on raspberrypi for capturing photographs or vedios with the camera module. The most important is that command line tool has feature grabbing image repeatly(mock FPS) from camera and print to file or console. They are:

1.  -o, --output : Output filename <filename> (to **write to stdout, use '-o -**'). If not specified, no file is saved
2.  -tl, --timelapse : Timelapse mode. Takes a picture every <t>ms
3.  -n, --nopreview : Do not display a preview window

so it is possible use java Runtime to launch raspixxx process and intercept its console output, makes it as
webcam driver. this is one simple and straightforward approach without native JNI or JNA call, no file system exchange. You will not struggle with performance issue and native code compiling. 

##Install

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install raspistill

raspistill --help //to check installation

## How To Use

Set capture driver before you start using Webcam class. this is one basic demo, check test source for demo with option panel.

```java
import java.awt.Dimension;
import java.awt.FlowLayout;

import javax.swing.JFrame;

import com.github.sarxos.webcam.Webcam;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamPanel;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamPanel.DrawMode;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamResolution;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.ds.raspistill.*;


public class WebcamPanelExample {

	static {
		//Webcam.setDriver(new RaspistillDriver());
		Webcam.setDriver(new RaspiYUVDriver());
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

		final JFrame window = new JFrame("Screen Capture Example");
		window.setResizable(true);
		window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		window.getContentPane().setLayout(new FlowLayout());

		final Dimension resolution = WebcamResolution.QVGA.getSize();

		for (final Webcam webcam : Webcam.getWebcams()) {

			webcam.setCustomViewSizes(resolution);
			webcam.setViewSize(resolution);
			webcam.open();

			final WebcamPanel panel = new WebcamPanel(webcam);
			panel.setFPSDisplayed(true);
			panel.setDrawMode(DrawMode.FIT);
			panel.setImageSizeDisplayed(true);
			panel.setPreferredSize(resolution);

			window.getContentPane().add(panel);
		}

		window.pack();
		window.setVisible(true);
	}
}
```
One demo snapshot as follows, please check WebcamPanelExample.java for detail.

## Known Problems

Becuase is pure java image processing, so performance is not good. The actually fps is low. According to test, about 500ms for PNG decoder to decode 640x480 image from raspistill stream.

## Driver Parameters
this driver makes above arguments configurable, when driver instance created, it will load arguments step by step as follows,
1. load built-in parameters
2. search system properties which starts with "raspi.". then merge to properties
3. You can set all command line arguments from device instance's setParameters
