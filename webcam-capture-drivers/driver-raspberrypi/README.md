# webcam-capture-driver-raspberrypi

This capture driver is designed special for raspberrypi. __raspistillï¼Œraspiyuv, ...__ are the command line tools on raspberrypi for capturing photographs or vedios with the camera module. The most important is that command line tools have feature grabbing image repeatly(mock FPS) from camera and print to file or console. They are:

1.  -o, --output : Output filename <filename> (to **write to stdout, use '-o -**'). If not specified, no file is saved
2.  -tl, --timelapse : Timelapse mode. Takes a picture every <t>ms
3.  -n, --nopreview : Do not display a preview window

So it is possible to use java `Runtime.execute()` to launch raspixxx process and intercept its console output, makes them as
webcam driver. this is one simple and straightforward approach without native JNI or JNA call, no file system exchange. You
will not struggle with performance issue and native code compiling. Because raspberrypi camera is connected to GPU directly,
the only CPU usage of drivers is converting rgb24 data to java BufferedImage, the system average CPU loading is 30% when
driver and Swing panel running.

## How To Use

Set capture driver before you start using Webcam class. this is one basic demo, check test source for demo with option panel.

```java
import java.awt.Dimension;
import java.awt.FlowLayout;

import javax.swing.JFrame;

import com.github.sarxos.webcam.Webcam;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamPanel;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamPanel.DrawMode;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamResolution;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.ds.raspberrypi.*;


public class WebcamPanelExample {

	static {
		//Webcam.setDriver(new RaspistillDriver());
		Webcam.setDriver(new RaspiYUVDriver());
		//Webcam.setDriver(new RaspividDriver());
		//Webcam.setDriver(new RaspividYUVDriver());
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

		final JFrame window = new JFrame("Raspberrypi Capture Example");
		window.setResizable(true);
		window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		window.getContentPane().setLayout(new FlowLayout());

		final Dimension resolution = WebcamResolution.QVGA.getSize();

		for (final Webcam webcam : Webcam.getWebcams()) {

			webcam.setCustomViewSizes(resolution);
			webcam.setViewSize(resolution);
			webcam.open();

			final WebcamPanel panel = new WebcamPanel(webcam);
			panel.setFPSDisplayed(true);
			panel.setDrawMode(DrawMode.FIT);
			panel.setImageSizeDisplayed(true);
			panel.setPreferredSize(resolution);

			window.getContentPane().add(panel);
		}

		window.pack();
		window.setVisible(true);
	}
}
```

Please check WebcamPanelExample.java in src/test/java for detail.

## Known Problems

Because is its based on pure Java image processing, the performance of `RaspistillDriver` and `RaspiYUVDriver` is not very good. The actuall FPS is low. According to test, about 500ms for PNG decoder to decode 640x480 image from raspistill stream. But the advantage of `RaspividDriver` and `RaspividYUVDriver` is the fact that Java code is comsuming RAW RGB24 data in _almost_ realtime by following native process STDOUT.

## Driver Parameters

This driver makes above arguments configurable, when driver instance created, it will load arguments step by step as follows:

1. Load built-in parameters
2. Search system properties which starts with "raspi.", then merge to properties
3. You can set all command line arguments from device instance's setParameters
