# webcam-capture-driver-screencapture

This is capture driver which is able to capture video feed from your screen devices. It uses AWT Robot under
the hood. Every screen device connected to your computer will be abstracted as a separate webcam device.

## How To Use

Set capture driver before you start using Webcam class.

```java
import java.awt.Dimension;
import java.awt.FlowLayout;

import javax.swing.JFrame;

import com.github.sarxos.webcam.Webcam;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamPanel;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamPanel.DrawMode;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.WebcamResolution;
import com.github.sarxos.webcam.ds.gstreamer.ScreenCaptureDriver;


public class WebcamPanelExample {

	static {
		Webcam.setDriver(new ScreenCaptureDriver());
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

		final JFrame window = new JFrame("Screen Capture Example");
		window.setResizable(true);
		window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		window.getContentPane().setLayout(new FlowLayout());

		final Dimension resolution = WebcamResolution.QVGA.getSize();

		for (final Webcam webcam : Webcam.getWebcams()) {

			webcam.setCustomViewSizes(resolution);
			webcam.setViewSize(resolution);
			webcam.open();

			final WebcamPanel panel = new WebcamPanel(webcam);
			panel.setFPSDisplayed(true);
			panel.setDrawMode(DrawMode.FIT);
			panel.setImageSizeDisplayed(true);
			panel.setPreferredSize(resolution);

			window.getContentPane().add(panel);
		}

		window.pack();
		window.setVisible(true);
	}
}
```
The picture below is an effect of the above code running. All my three screens are captured in real time.

## Known Problems

1. I noticed this on my Ubuntu Linux - black regions appear in place where other application (e.g. Cairo Dock)
   render OpenGL content. I don't know about any workaround or solution for this problem other than disabling
   these applications. Not verified on Mac and Windows. Please report
   [new issue](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/issues/new) if you know how to fix this.
